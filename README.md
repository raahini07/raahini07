# Hey! Iâ€™m Raahini ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a 16-year-old student passionate about aerospace engineering and computer science. Iâ€™m always excited to learn new things, solve real-world problems through code, and explore how technology can make a difference.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been focused on full-stack development and learning how to build responsive, interactive web apps. I'm especially interested in the intersection of software and space, and where that might lead in the future.

If youâ€™re working on something cool or just want to connect, feel free to reach out at **raahini07@gmail.com** â€” Iâ€™d love to chat!
